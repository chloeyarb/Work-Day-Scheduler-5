# Work-Day-Scheduler-5

This weeks challenge focuses on incorporating Third Party API's to help create a work dday calendar application. Features for this app include a display of the date and time at the 
top of the page, color-coded time blocks that represent the past, present, and future, ability to insert events, and save the events in local storage. The starter code for this 
project includes Bootstrap, which gives the developer an opportunity to review the Bootstrap documentation and its correlating classes. This challenge also gave exposure to the Moment.js
library in order to include the date and time, which is an essential component to a calendar.
